# JediParticle
A real-time, hand-gesture-controlled 3D particle system built with Three.js and MediaPipe Hands. The project maps natural hand movements to calibrated zoom, knob-like rotation, and inertial flick gestures, with jitter filtering, pauseable control modes, and live visual feedback for a smooth, physical interaction experience.
